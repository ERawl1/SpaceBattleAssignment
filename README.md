# SpaceBattleAssignment
A Space Battle simulation for my Game engines 2 module

## Description
- Evan Rawl
- Tu984/3
- Game Engines 2

 ## What I hope to achieve:
A space battle based off of "The Long Night of Solace" from Halo: Reach. I hope to have a space battle between two factions, where the Covenant assault the UNSC frigate, and the UNSC fighters fend off the attackers and defend and patrol their position. Since the player plays out this battle in the original game, I would like to have cinematic views of the battle, and possibly a special camera following one of the fighters to represent the player character in Halo: Reach.

## Planned features:
- Waves of enemies to represent the games hold-out section. 
- Enemies will actively try to attack the frigate.
- Debris from wreckages for the combatants to navigate around while fighting.
- Different enemy types and behaviours.

## Project so far:
- Created initial project file.
- Imported ship models.
- Basic movement script.
- Path following and path manager
- Ship wander script with adjustable patrol and chase functions
- RTS Style Camera able to scroll to zoom, move around and pan for different views of the scene
- Scene set up for atmospshere
- Added more models to flesh out scene
- Skybox added
- Music added to scene

# Issues facing the project:
I had originally planned to add a lot more and complex features to the project, but unfortunately due to other projects and falling ill with covid for quite some time I lost a lot of time on the project. 

# How to use:
Uses Unity2021.1.22f1 and should work from the get go after downloading and opening.

The camera can be moved by using the WASD keys in Game mode.
The camera can be panned by holding middle mouse button and moving the mouse.
The camera can be zoomed by scrolling the mouse scroll wheel forward or back.

# Models:
I downloaded models from Thingiverse to use in the project and applied a material to match their col,ours from the game.
