# SpaceBattleAssignment
A Space Battle simulation for my Game engines 2 module

## Description
- Evan Rawl
- Tu984/3
- Game Engines 2

 ## What I hope to achieve:
A space battle based off of "The Long Night of Solace" from Halo: Reach. I hope to have a space battle between two factions, where the Covenant assault the UNSC frigate, and the UNSC fighters fend off the attackers and defend and patrol their position. Since the player plays out this battle in the original game, I would like to have cinematic views of the battle, and possibly a special camera following one of the fighters to represent the player character in Halo: Reach.

## Planned features:
- Waves of enemies to represent the games hold-out section. 
- Enemies will actively try to attack the frigate.
- Debris from wreckages for the combatants to navigate around while fighting.
- Different enemy types and behaviours.

## Project so far:
- Created initial project file.
- Imported ship models.
- Basic movement script.

## Storyboard:
For my video, I want to create a video reminiscent of the cutscenes and gameplay of the referenced mission.
